    "″Authorized Use″ – the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the\n",
    "Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units (″MSUs″),\n",
    "Processor Value Units (″PVUs″), or other level of use specified by IBM.\n",
    "″IBM″ – International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.\n",
    "″License Information″ (″LI″) – a document that provides information and any additional terms\n",
    "specific to a Program. The Program’s LI is available at www.ibm.com/software/sla. The LI can\n",

    "LI, and the PoE and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of\n",
    "the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM\n",
    "concerning Licensee’s use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of\n",

    "3. License Grant\n",
    "The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.\n",
    "IBM grants Licensee a nonexclusive license to 1) use the Program up to the Authorized Use\n",
    "specified in the PoE, 2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use, and 3) make a\n",

    "partial copy, of the Program;\n",
    "d. Licensee ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1)\n",
    "does so only on Licensee’s behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;\n",
    "e. Licensee does not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly\n",
    "permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or\n",
    "reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility\n",
    "of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program’s components, files, modules, audio-visual\n",
    "content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or\n",

    "of another IBM Program (″Principal Program″) and identified as a Supporting Program in\n",
    "the Principal Program’s LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without\n",
    "these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the\n",
    "Supporting Program.)\n",
    "This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.\n",
    "3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches\n",

    "If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program’s license is promptly\n",
    "terminated.\n",
    "3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches\n",
    "When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional\n",
    "or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If\n",
    "no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to\n",
    "this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly\n",
    "discontinue use of the replaced Program.\n",
    "3.2 Fixed Term Licenses\n",
    "If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee’s license is terminated at the end of the\n",
    "fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.\n",
    "3.3 Term and Termination\n",
    "This Agreement is effective until terminated.\n",
    "IBM may terminate Licensee’s license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this\n",
    "Agreement.\n",

    "Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect\n",
    "until fulfilled, and apply to both parties’ respective successors and assignees.\n",
    "4. Charges\n",
    "Charges are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not\n",
    "give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this\n",
    "Agreement.\n",
    "If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or an authorized\n",
    "IBM reseller in advance and pay any applicable charges.\n",

    "5. Taxes\n",
    "If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding those based on\n",
    "IBM’s net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as specified in an invoice, or\n",
    "supply exemption documentation. Licensee is responsible for any personal property taxes for\n",
    "the Program from the date that Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty,\n",
    "tax, levy, or fee for the import into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program outside\n",
    "the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, then Licensee agrees that it\n",
    "is responsible for, and will pay, any amount imposed.\n",
    "6. Money-back Guarantee\n",
    "If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original Licensee, Licensee\n",
    "may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount Licensee paid for the Program,\n",
    "provided that Licensee returns the Program and PoE to the party from whom Licensee obtained\n",
    "it within 30 days of the date the PoE was issued to Licensee. If the license is for a fixed term\n",

    "are returned within the first 30 days of the initial term. If Licensee downloaded the Program,\n",
    "Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to\n",
    "obtain the refund.\n",
    "7. Program Transfer\n",
    "Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee’s license rights and obligations to\n",
    "another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the license is\n",

    "to another party. Licensee may not transfer a portion of 1) the Program or 2) the Program’s\n",
    "Authorized Use. When Licensee transfers the Program, Licensee must also transfer a hard copy\n",
    "of this Agreement, including the LI and PoE. Immediately after the transfer, Licensee’s license\n",
    "terminates.\n",
    "8. Warranty and Exclusions\n",
    "8.1 Limited Warranty\n",

    "language, unless otherwise required by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver\n",
    "or limitation.\n",
    "The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does not warrant\n",
    "uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program, or that IBM will correct all Program\n",

    "other contract or tort claim), IBM’s entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or\n",
    "related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount\n",

    "Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.\n",
    "11.1 Verification Process\n",
    "Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records,\n",

    "that Licensee’s use of all Programs is in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms, including,\n",
    "without limitation, all of IBM’s applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is\n",
    "responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in\n",
    "compliance with IPLA Program Terms.\n",
    "Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee’s compliance with IPLA Program Terms at all\n",
    "sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to\n",
    "IPLA Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes\n",
    "disruption to Licensee’s business, and may be conducted on Licensee’s premises, during normal\n",
    "business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided\n",
    "IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.\n",
    "11.2 Resolution\n",
    "IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any\n",
    "Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the IPLA\n",
    "Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies\n",
    "in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the\n",
    "duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities\n",
    "determined as a result of such verification.\n",
