## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Deloitte Consulting - Project – Supply Chain GenAI Dec. 202 3 – Present**
_GenAI Engineer/Scientist – Supply Chain Melbourne/Sydney, Australia_
- Spearheaded the development of a VectorDB solution utilising OpenAI ADA embeddings. Implemented two innovative methods to extract daily insights from news articles from reputable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters.
- Embedding news articles with OpenAI and Weaviate into VectorDB, followed by querying a subset of topics to find articles with similar context. Leveraging GPU enabled data processing for data transformations and ML (NVIDIA Rapids)
- Grouped embeddings into clusters and identifying topics within these clusters. These clusters were then analysed using both off-the-shelf and custom-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for topic modelling. The fine-tuning of LLMs was carried out at various stages of the process, including individual article summary and cluster topic extraction.
- Strategically fine-tuned and evaluated LLMs (Google Gemma, Flan-T5, Llama, Mistral), aligning model selection with business objectives by balancing cost, speed, and accuracy for nuanced text analysis tasks.
- Evaluated leading edge multi-modal AI applications, implementing GPT4V, LLava, BLIP for financial report analysis, enhancing data interpretation from visual elements alongside RAG systems for textual insights.

**Deloitte Consulting – Project – Computer Vision Engineer July 2023 – Dec. 2023**
_Data Scientist (Statistics & Machine Learning) – Mining Sector (ASX100) Melbourne/Sydney, Australia_
- Selected as Computer Vision engineer to deliver a License Plate Detection & Recognition solution to feed into a safety culture monitoring system for an ASX listed international mining client.
- Conducted extensive research and deployed innovative solutions, including a high-performing baseline, leveraging cutting edge models in LPR/LPD technology.
- Pioneered the trailing and integration of NVIDIA's pre-trained models and cutting-edge tools (Tao Toolkit, Triton, TensorRT) into the project, marking a milestone as the first national implementation of NVIDIA tech for a client.
- Deployed model on cloud platform for batch inference with API interface.

**Deloitte Consulting - Assets – Data Scientist Apr. 202 3 – Present**
_Data Scientist (Generative AI) – Sector Agnostic Melbourne/Sydney, Australia_
- Fine-tuned multi-modal Vision Language Model on Image-to-Text task to feed into a multi-modal RAG pipeline. First PoC of its kind at Deloitte.
- Developed a custom RAG-based Q&A system for PDF input analysis, integrating OpenAI Embeddings, Pinecone Vector DB, and Langchain Prompt Chaining. Demonstrated its efficacy in the financial regulatory sector.
- Orchestrated the creation of a LLM asset for detecting churn signals in home-loan products, using call-centre transcripts, and tailoring the solution for banking sector specific linguistics.
- Implemented PEFT Fine-tuning for LLMs to prove the value of Parameter Efficient methods for fine-tuning on a tangible business use-case (Knowledge Editing for Domain Adaptation). Implemented PoC of first p-tuned NVIDIA NeMo LLM nationally.
- Served as a key liaison between Deloitte and NVIDIA (APAC and Silicon Valley), enhancing the strategic partnership and collaboration.
- Utilized Vision Language Models (CLIP/NeVa) to develop Vision-based demos, offering an efficient alternative to fine-tuning object detection models in resource-limited scenarios.
- Led the implementation and analysis of NVIDIA NeMo guardrails for LLMs, reporting key insights to senior leadership. Introduced 'Self-RAG' to the firm, an innovative framework enhancing trust and accuracy in LLM responses, emphasizing AI safety and reliability.
- Led the firm’s upskilling of business-critical skillsets in NVIDIA technologies. (Accelerated Compute, Deep Learning, Omniverse, Generative AI)

**Deloitte Consulting – Project – AI Ethics July 2023 – Nov. 2023**
_Data Scientist (Statistics & Machine Learning)- Insurance Sector (ASX100) Sydney, Australia_
- Engaged by a major Australian insurer to conduct an independent evaluation focusing on ethics and bias in their algorithmic pricing strategies.
- Utilised two distinct machine learning models: Huber regressor for a simplified approach and XGBoost for an advanced analysis. Assessed potential biases via residual analysis post-model fitting.
- Leveraged Bayesian optimisation through Optuna with a bespoke objective function. The function aimed to minimise model overfitting (controlled by the alpha parameter) while maximising R^2 to optimise model performance.
- Developed an end-to-end automated pipeline, incorporating both modelling and resultant visual analytics, configured for recurring execution.

**Deloitte Consulting - Project – Full-Stack Data Scientist Mar. 202 3 – Sept.**
_Data Scientist (Computer Vision) – Agricultural Sector Melbourne/Amsterdam, Australia/Netherlands_
- Liaise with global network of Computer Vision experts to train/upskill and port business-critical AI/CV IP to AU.
- Implement E2E Machine Learning pipeline on the cloud (AWS), including Computer Vision model retraining, MLOps, Web Interface (Django), BI reporting.
- Build foundational data platform for Australian environment in AWS, leveraging Lakehouse architecture (AWS S3, AWS Redshift)
- Liaise with senior partners in the Meat/Livestock/Agriculture industry to tailor models/solutions for the Australian market.

**Deloitte Consulting - Project - Large Retail Client Aug. 20 22 – Dec. 2022**
_Data Scientist (Time-Series Forecasting) – Retail Sector Sydney, Australia_
